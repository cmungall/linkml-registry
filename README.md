# LinkML Registry

Registry of LinkML schemas

See the registry:

 * [linkml-registry](https://linkml.github.io/linkml-registry/registry/)

Metadata:

 * [models.yaml](models.yaml)

Registry Schema:

 * [https://linkml.github.io/linkml-registry/registry/](https://linkml.github.io/linkml-registry/registry)

## How to register a schema

Make a Pull Request on:

 * [src/data/models.yaml](src/data/models.yaml)

You should also add the `linkml` tag on your repo so it shows up here: [https://github.com/topics/linkml](https://github.com/topics/linkml)

This is then compiled to the models.yaml in the top level (do not edit this directly). Currently this is a manual step but in future this will be done with github actions
